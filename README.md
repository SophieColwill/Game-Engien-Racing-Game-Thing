# Command
I implmented the command design pattern to make WASD & Arrow Key capatability. Essentially, both A & Left Arrow do the same thing, and both D & Right Arrow do the same thing as well. This is done by checking when the stated buttons have been pressed, and if they have been they will execute the appropriate command refrence. I did this to make several different playstyles compatible since not everyone wants to use WASD or Arrow Keys. With this in mind, I could also make J & L move the player character right or left.

I think that, if I hadn't panicked over my Github being semi unavailable, I would have been able to implement stuff better. Otherwise I did quickly figure out a way to implement it into the previously created project, then succesfully doing so in a similar amount of time.
